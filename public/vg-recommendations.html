<h1>3 Videogame recommendations for this month!</h1>
<p>
  I love indie games! People should try to play something different more often.
  Give them a chance.
</p>
<p>Check out games 2 and 3 for indie game recommendations.</p>
<p>
  I also made some little icons for each game, since I've been learning some
  pixel art.

<h3>Super Mario Galaxy</h3>

<p>Beautiful soundtrack and imaginative gameplay.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not so easy to come by today.</p>

<h3>Subnautica</h3>

<p>
  Absolutely incredible mood. The feeling of terror as you dive deeper into the
  ocean is one-of-a-kind.

<p>Just a very underrated game that should be mentioned more. Play it.</p>
